\begin_layout Title
Wireless Communications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Cellular Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In celullar networks, the data is not transmited along a direct path, but
 uses an external network to relay the signal.
 Different technologies are already commercially deployed, such as HSCD,
 GPRS, EDGE or UMTS, and other still under developtment such as LTE or WIMAX
 (IEEE 802.16).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In theory, the range of 2G and 3G networks is unlimited, as they essentially
 consist of countless smaller networks that are linked together.
 In practice, these networks do not cover remote, sparsely populated areas.
 When considering the data rate, it appears that 2G is designed for speech
 purposes and therefore the data rate is insufficient to support image transmiss
ion.
 Although 3G is better suited for such puposes, the commercial costs of
 a privately operated network are high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to implement the cellular concept with a self-created network
 in which a cellular base station such as an IP.Access nanoBTS module represents
 the fixed infrastructure side of the network.
 In combination with a 2G or 3G device attached to a UAV, a fully functional
 network can then be established.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Satellite Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In satellite communication, the data is not transmited along a direct path,
 but uses a constellation of satellites to relay the signal, such as Globalstar,
 Orbcomm or Iridium.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Satellite communication finds many applications in remote areas where the
 range of other forms of wireless communication is a limiting factor.
 A drawback of satellite communication is the high cost and low data rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Free Space Optical Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In pointing-acquisition-tracking (PAT) systems, the data is transmited along
 a direct path, by using a modulated light beam.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advantage of PAT systems is the difficulty of signal interception and
 high data rates of up to 1 Gbps.
 However, drawbacks of such a line-of-sight (LOS) system are dependence
 on the weather condition (humidity, clouds) and limited range due to pointing
 inaccuracy, even with expensive hardware.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Wireless LAN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WLAN (IEEE 802.11) is a replacement or extension for wired LAN such as Ethernet
 (IEEE 802.3).
 The original IEEE 802.11 protocol was amended with several subprotocols
 when the 1â€“2 Mbps data rate of the original standard could be extended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most widely used protocols are 802.11b/g/n, of which the recently introduced
 802.11n protocol has become increasingly popular due to its high data rate
 and reliability.
 Despite high data rates the range of WLAN is limited to 100 m, even with
 line-of-sight communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Wireless PAN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WPAN (IEEE 802.15) were created to provide the means for power-efficient
 wireless communication within the personal operating space (spherical region
 that surrounds a wireless device).
 Depending of the data rate, WPANs are divided into three common classes:
 high rate, medium rate (Bluetooth) and low rate (ZigBee)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bluetooth (IEE 802.15.1) was designed as a short-range (often <10 m), low-power
 wireless connection protocol between two computers or portable devices
 with a data rate of up to 1Mps.
 Long-range Bluetooth adapters with a range of over 1000 m are commercially
 available, although the transmission power of these modules does not comply
 with European Union (EU) regulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ZigBee (IEE 802.15.4) allows data rates of up to 250 kbps over roughly 1.6
 km in free space.
 An advantage of the ZigBee protocol is that a link between two endpoints
 can easily be extended to include multiple nodes, and that it can be implemente
d using low-cost hardware such as XBee (<50 per module).

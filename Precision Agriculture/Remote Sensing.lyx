Remote Sensing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three basic types of information required for PA: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
information on seasonally stable conditions, i.e, those that are relatively
 constant through the crop growing season, such as yield-based or soil-based
 management units, and only need to be determined preseason and simply updated,
 when and if necessary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
information on seasonally variable conditions, i.e, those that change continually
 within the season, such as soil moisture, weed or insect infestations,
 and crop disease, and need to be determined numerous times during the season
 for proper management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
information required to diagnose the cause of the crop yield variability
 and develop a management strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
in nearly every application of PA and in every agro-meteorological model,
 knowledge of spatial variations in meteorological conditions is crucial.
 Multispectral images of coarse spatial resolution and fine temporal resolution
 should be used to produce local or regional maps of meteorological parameters
 such as insolation, PAR, rainfall, and others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are to approach to meet the information requirements of PA:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tractor based sensors which control variable rate applicators in near-real
 time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
satellite, airborne or uav spectral observations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Tractor-based sensors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several such sensors have been developed for measuring:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
soil organic matter (Tyler, 1994)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
soil nitrate levels (Adsett and Zoerb, 1991) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
soil clay content and thickness (Sudduth et al., 1995).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
weed sensors to discriminate weeds from standing crops (Thompson et al.,
 1990; Gu-yer et al., 1993)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a tractor-based charged couple device (CCD) camera to discriminate plants
 from soil and trash for guiding most-beneficial chemical applications (Cai
 and Palmer, 1994)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a sensor for assessing crop nitrogen status based on an in-field reference
 of known nitro-gen status (Blackmer et al., 1996).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a fluorescence technique that allowed discrimination of residue from bare
 soil, and a commercial prototype that could be mounted on a trailer (Daughtry
 et al.
 1995) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Satellite, airborne or uav spectral observations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spectral observed imnages are usually transformed pixel by pixel according
 to certain vegetation indexes, which are more suitable for the analysis
 of crop and soil conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index â€“ Green (NDVI-green)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Photosynthetic Vigor Ratio (PVR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Plant Pigment Ratio (PPR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mapping Seasonally Stable Conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Grain Yield Monitor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yield maps collected for several growing seasons can provide an integrated
 expression of relative productivity that is a property of the field and
 unchanging from year-to-year and from crop-to-crop.
 Yield maps have been used directly for management of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
fertilizer application (Schueller and Bae, 1987; Eliason et al., 1995), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
water application (King et al., 1995)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
planting and soil engaging operations (Schueller, 1988)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
have important indirect applications in management of weeds, insects, and
 crop diseases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Conventional Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The production of grain yield maps generally requires that instantaneous
 grain yields acquired at coarse and/or variant resolutions with DGPS positionin
g be interpolated to obtain average yields at a given, finer resolution.
 Generally, geostatistical analysis is used for this interpolation, based
 on kriging or the simpler inverse distance technique (Murphy et al., 1995).
 Long et al.
 (1995) compared four methods for deriving yield maps from combine-based
 yield measurements: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
interpreting soil survey maps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
interpreting aerial photographs (transformed to NDVI?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
two kriging-based methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Multispectral images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most studies suggest that NDVI can be effective for providing information
 on germination and vegetative stages, but this information must be combined
 with input from an agrometeorological model to accurately determine crop
 yields (Patel et al., 1991; Rudorff and Batista, 1991).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Soil Fertility Properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nielsen et al.
 (1995) identified several of the most important soil fertility attributes
 that could be mapped and managed for improved yield: available soil nitrogen
 or some other macro or micro plant nutrient, relative position and slope
 of the terrain, soil organic matter content.
 Maps of soil fertility and physical attributes are being used in PA to
 determine the responsive and nonresponsive parts of fields (Wolkowski and
 Wollenhaupt, 1995):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Soil organic matter content has been directly related to the efficacy and
 rate of fertilizer applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Soil physical properties or landscape may be even more important than soil
 fertility in explaining yield variations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Conventional Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bell et al.
 (1995) outlined three approaches for mapping soil variability for PA: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
county soil surveys at 1:12,000 to 1:24,000 scales
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
geostatistical interpolation techniques (e.g., kriging) to map soil properties
 from a grid of point samples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use of soil/landscape models with input from either remote sensing or a
 digital elevation map (DEM)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Multispectral images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the relations among soil reflectance and soil properties, remotely
 sensed images are not currently being used to map soil characteristics
 on a routine basis.
 This is because the reflectance characteristics of the desired soil properties
 (e.g., organic matter, texture, iron content) are often confused by variability
 in soil moisture content, surface roughness, climate factors, solar zenith
 angle, and view angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mapping Seasonally Variable Conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Soil Moisture Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information on within-field soil moisture variation throughout the season
 has been shown to be relevant to decisions made about:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tillage activities (Lindstrom et al., 1995)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
nitrogen applications (Hug-gins and Alderfer, 1995; Sadler et al., 1995)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soil Moisture Content has been usually monitory through SAR technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Crop Phenology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowledge of the stage of the crop development is useful for time-specific
 crop management such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
minimizing or maximizing crop stress during crucial periods (e.g., grain filling
 in wheat, anthesis of corn, or sugar development in cantaloupe).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the vegetative, reproductive and senescing phases of wheat
 crops have been discriminated based on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
seasonal shifts in the red edge (Railyan and Korobov, 1993)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
bidirectional reflectance measurements (Zipoli and Grifoni, 1994)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
measurements of reflected polarized light (Ghosh et al., 1993)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
temporal monitoring of NDVI (Boissard et al., 1993).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Crop Growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common approach in remote sensing for measuring or monitoring crop
 growth is the empirical correlation of VI with such crop variables as LAI,
 percent veg-etation cover, vegetation phytomass and fraction of absorbed
 photosynthetically active radiance.
 The basic theory of this approach is well understood (Jackson and Huete,
 1991); and recent improvements to this approach include developing VIs
 are that insensitive to soil/atmosphere/sensor noise (e.g., Huete, 1988;
 Malthus et al., 1993) and developing empirical relations that are robust
 for application to a variety of crops, locations, and conditions (Richardson
 et al., 1992; 1993; Wie-gand et al., 1992).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other approach is based on crop growth models.
 An example of the former was presented by Clevers et al.
 (1994) using optical reflectance measurements to calibrate the SUCROS crop
 growth model and improve estimates of crop yield.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other approach is based on canopy radiative transfer models (RTM).
 An example of the latter was presented by Kimes et al.
 (1991) in the development of a knowledge-based system (VEG) to infer reflectanc
es of a vegetation target, or inversely, to derive vegetation characteristics
 from multiband or multiview reflectance measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Crop Stress through Evapotranspiration Rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crop stress be a consequence of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
nutrient deficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
crop disease 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
water deficiency 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
some insect infestations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
other problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the fact that crop stress is often manifested by a decrease in the
 transpiration rate of the crop, some work has been conducted to use remote
 sensing for monitoring crop evapotranspiration rates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the more promising approaches for operational application is the
 use of remotely sensed 
\emph on
crop coefficients
\emph default
 (the ratio of actual crop evapotranspiration and that of a reference crop)
 for estimation of actual, site-specific crop evapotranspiration rate from
 readily available meteorological information.
 This approach requires only a measure of spectral vege-tation index like
 NDVI.
 (e.g., Bausch, 1993)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another approach that has obtained commercial success is the 
\emph on
crop water stress index
\emph default
 (CWSI), which provides a measure of crop stress from 0 to 1 based on the
 difference between surface and air temperature with reference to the vapor
 pressure deficit and a crop-specific baseline (Jackson et al., 1981, Moran
 and Jackson (1991) and Norman et al.
 (1995)].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Crop Nutrient Deficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plant nitrogen content and canopy nitrogen deficits have been related to
 reflectance measurements in the green (0.545 pm), red (0.66 pm), and NIR
 (0.80 pm) spectrum (Fernandez et al., 1994; Buschmann and Nagel, 1993).
 However, most such relations are sensitive to variations in soil reflectance,
 and the best bandwidths are narrow and unavailable with satellite-based
 wide-band sensors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Crop Disease
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though wide visible and near-infrared bands may be helpful for discriminating
 healthy and diseased crops (due to changes in foliage density, leaf area,
 leaf angles, or canopy structure), the best results for identifying diseases
 were obtained with hyperspectral information in the visible and near-infrared
 spectrum.
 Discrimination of diseases may be possible with knowledge of the physiological
 effect of the disease on leaf and canopy elements.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
necrotic diseases can cause a darkening of leaves in the visible spectrum
 and a cell collapse that would decrease near-infrared reflectance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
chlorosis inducing diseases (mildews and some virus) cause marked changes
 in the visible reflectance (similar to N deficiency).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
other diseases may be detected by their ef-fects on canopy geometry (wilting
 or decreases in LAI).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Weed Infestation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For precision management of pre-plant applications, the information requirement
 is simply determination of presence or absence of plants, and the remote
 sensors (e.g., Richardson et al., 1985) should be comparably simple, such
 as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the tractor-based sensors 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
interpretation of digital images based on VI 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
supervised classification 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For precision management of postemergence herbicide applications, it is
 required discrimination between weeds and crops.
 This is generally accomplished based on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the differences in the visible/NIR spectral signatures of crops and specific
 weeds (Brown et al., 1994) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
by acquiring images at specific times during the season when weed coloring
 is particularly distinctive (i.e., during flowering).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Insect Infestation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indirectly, insect damage to plants has been detected through remote sensing
 of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
insect habitat (Hugh-Jones et al., 1992)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
growth and yield of plants (Vogelmann and Rock, 1989)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
changes in plant chemistry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Determining Causes of Yield Variability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remote sensing has a variety of roles in determining the cause of spatial
 and temporal crop and soil variability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use of hyperspectral imagers for direct crop diagnosis.
 In this review we have cited examples where hyperspectral data in the visible
 and NIR wavelengths have been used successfully for discrimination of crop
 stress caused by nutrient deficiency, crop disease, water stress, and more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use of remote sensing information to improve the capacity and accuracy of
 DSS and agronomic models by providing accurate input information or as
 a means of model calibration or validation.
 The link between remote sensing and simulation modeling has been illustrated
 through examples of the use of remote sensing for parameterization of models
 (Wiegand et al., 1986b), within-season model calibration (Maas, 1993), and
 model validation (Fischer, 1994).
